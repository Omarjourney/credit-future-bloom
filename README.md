## AI integration roadmap  
To make this credit repair project more engaging and valuable for users, consider integrating AI capabilities:  

- **Credit‑report analysis**: Use an AI model to parse uploaded credit reports, highlight errors and provide personalized suggestions for improvement.  
- **Credit‑score simulator**: Implement a simulator that estimates how financial actions (e.g., paying down debt, opening new accounts) may affect users' scores, explaining the reasoning behind changes.  
- **Dispute‑letter generator**: Provide an automated tool that drafts dispute letters to contest inaccuracies, ensuring compliance with credit‑repair regulations.  
- **Personalized financial coaching**: Offer a chat‑based AI assistant that gives budgeting tips, debt‑repayment strategies and negotiation advice tailored to each user.  
- **Continuous monitoring & alerts**: Monitor credit changes and notify users about important events such as new inquiries or missed payments.  

These AI features will improve usability and help users understand and improve their credit more effectively.
